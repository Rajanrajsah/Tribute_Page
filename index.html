                <h5>First Terms : <span>1997</span></h5>

                <p>During a BJP conference in Mumbai in November 1995, BJP President Advani declared that Vajpayee would be the party's prime ministerial candidate in the forthcoming elections. Vajpayee himself was reported to be unhappy with the announcement,
                    responding by saying that the party needed to win the election first.The BJP became the single largest party in Parliament in the 1996 general election, helped by religious polarisation across the country as a result of the demolition
                    of the Babri Masjid.Indian president Shankar Dayal Sharma invited Vajpayee to form the government. Vajpayee was sworn in as the 10th prime minister of India, but the BJP failed to muster a majority among members of the Lok Sabha. Vajpayee
                    resigned after 16 days, when it became clear that he did not have enough support to form a government.In this short period, he also created and administered the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution.</p>
                <p>


                    <h5>Second Terms :<span> 1998-1999</span></h5>
                </p>
                <p>After the fall of the two United Front governments between 1996 and 1998, the Lok Sabha was dissolved and fresh elections were held. The 1998 general elections again put the BJP ahead of others. A number of political parties joined the
                    BJP to form the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), and Vajpayee was sworn in as the prime minister. The coalition was an uneasy one, as apart from the Shiv Sena, none of the other parties espoused the BJP's Hindu-nationalist ideology.
                    Vajpayee has been credited for managing this coalition successfully, while facing ideological pressure from the hardline wing of the party and from the RSS. Vajpayee's government lasted 13 months until mid-1999 when the All India Anna
                    Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) under J. Jayalalithaa withdrew its support.The government lost the ensuing vote of confidence motion in the Lok Sabha by a single vote on 17 April 1999.As the opposition was unable to come up with
                    the numbers to form the new government, the Lok Sabha was again dissolved and fresh elections were held.</p>
